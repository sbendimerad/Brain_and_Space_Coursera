- [x] Intromission Theory
- [ ] Theory of Vision
- [ ] Emission Theory
- [ ] Extramission Theory

## Question 2
**Alhazen is significant because:**

- [ ] He was the first to dissect an eye
- [x] He argued convincingly that vision involves light and that light enters the eye, rather than vice versa
- [ ] He was the first to suggest that all matter is made of the elements earth, fire, air, and water
- [ ] All of the above

## Question 3
**Democritus and Plato:**

- [x] Disagreed about whether vision involves the eye sending something outward or whether the eye receives something emitted by the visual scene
- [ ] Agreed about what kind of physical stimulus or event vision entails

## Question 4
**Light detection involves:**

- [ ] Special neurons called photoreceptors
- [ ] Molecules called photopigments
- [ ] The absorption of photons which causes changes in the shape of photopigment molecules
- [x] All of the above

## Question 5
**What do photons of light do?**

- [x] Temporarily break a double bond in a photopigment molecule called rhodopsin, causing a change in the shape of rhodopsin
- [ ] Cause two molecules of rhodopsin to bond together to form a new molecule
- [ ] They are converted by rhodopsin into electrons inside photoreceptor neurons
- [ ] All of the above

## Question 6
**The process of converting light into a neural signal involves:**

- [ ] Alteration of the shape of photopigments by light
- [ ] A biochemical cascade leading to the closure of sodium ion channels
- [ ] A negative change in the electrical potential of photoreceptor neurons
- [x] All of the above

## Question 7
**Ion channels:**

- [ ] Create pores in the membranes of neurons
- [ ] Regulate the flow of ions into or out of neurons
- [ ] Control the electrical signals of neurons
- [x] All of the above

## Question 8
**An individual photon ultimately affects:**

- [ ] One photopigment molecule leading to an impact on one ion channel
- [ ] One photopigment molecule leading to an impact on many ion channels
- [ ] Many photopigment molecules which team up to affect one ion channel
- [x] Any of the above can happen, depending on the type of photon

## Question 9
**Image formation occurs when:**

- [ ] Light sensing cells are located at the back of an eye
- [ ] The pupil regulates the path of light to the rear surface of the eye
- [ ] The lens and other structures refract light to focus it on the rear surface of the eye
- [x] All of the above

## Question 10
**Light sensing:**

- [ ] Occurs in plants
- [ ] Occurs in simple animals
- [ ] Occurs in humans
- [x] All of the above

## Question 11
**Image formation involves:**

- [ ] Light traveling in straight lines
- [ ] Creation of a one-to-one correspondence between locations in the visual scene and locations on the retina impacted by light originating from those locations
- [ ] Light passing through apertures or pinholes
- [x] All of the above

## Question 12
**Which of the following statements concerning apertures or pinholes are correct?**

- [ ] Apertures or pinholes are responsible for the images formed in a camera obscura
- [ ] The pupil is effectively an aperture or pinhole
- [ ] The aperture in the front of the eye is large and would produce blurry vision if it were not for other factors
- [x] All of the above

## Question 13
**Kepler realized that vision is not as blurry as it should be, if the ___________________ were the only thing(s) responsible for image formation.**

- [ ] Pupil
- [ ] Lens
- [ ] Camera obscura
- [x] All of the above

## Question 14
**What did Kepler propose is the reason for our clarity of vision?**

- [ ] The elliptical shape of the orbits of the planets
- [ ] A process whereby the image is magnified when it is projected on the retina.
- [x] Refraction: light bends when it transitions from air to more dense materials, creating a focused image on the retina.
- [ ] Refraction: more light flows into the aperture of the eye, fine-tuning the image and reducing blur.

## Question 15
**Which of the following anatomical features contribute(s) to refraction of light within the eye?**

- [ ] Cornea
- [ ] Lens
- [x] Anything made of fluid or substances that are more dense than air

## Question 16
**How is an image projected onto the back of the retina?**

- [ ] The same way that it is seen
- [x] Upside-down and backwards
- [ ] Right-side up and backwards
- [ ] Upside down only

## Question 17
**What was the purpose of the Inversion Prism goggles experiments performed?**

- [ ] To observe the distortion in visual activity created by light refraction.
- [ ] To change the aperture of the eye so that the amount of blur can be controlled and studied.
- [x] To see if the brain will adjust to normal function if the image projected on the back of the retina is changed.
- [ ] To witness how phototransduction changes if the conformational change does not occur.
