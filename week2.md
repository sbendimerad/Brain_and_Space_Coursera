- [ ] Hyperpolarization

- [ ] Sodium channels are being inactivated.
- [ ] Potassium channels are beginning to open.
- [x] Sodium channels are beginning to open.
- [ ] All of the above are true.

## Question 10
**What do vibrations simulate when applied to a muscle?**

- [ ] They give the illusion of being numb; it seems like no movement is taking place even though it is.
- [ ] They give the illusion of displacement; it feels like a movement occurring in one part of the body is happening in another.
- [ ] They give the illusion of force, even though there is no tension on the muscle.
- [x] They give the illusion of stretching, even though the muscle has not changed position.

## Question 11
**Based on the “Crossed Hands” experiment, while holding one vibrating device in, where would the initial eye gaze be directed if the hands are crossed and the vibration occurs in the right hand?**

- [ ] Usually to the middle, between the two hands
- [ ] No eye movements are made in response to the vibration
- [ ] Always to the left, i.e. to the correct hand
- [x] Sometimes to the right, i.e. to the wrong hand

## Question 12
**An experimenter wears prism goggles that shift the view slightly to the right. He then throws bean bags towards a target with one hand until he hits the target with relative consistency. He takes off the goggle and tries to throw one bean bag with that same hand. What would most likely happen?**

- [ ] He would throw the bean bag slightly to the right of the target
- [ ] He would throw the bean bag relatively to the center, towards the target
- [ ] The answer can’t be predicted from the information provided
- [x] He would throw the bean bag slightly to the left of the target

## Question 13
**Which of the following accurately describes the phenomenon of motion parallax and its contributions to creating three-dimensional vision?**

- [x] When an observer moves, objects that are farther away from an observer appear to move less than objects that are closer.
- [ ] Occurs when one object blocks another object
- [ ] Assuming that light is coming from above allows you to determine from the pattern of shadows whether an object is concave or convex.
- [ ] Adjustment of lens curvature allows for observation of images more clearly; monitoring that “setting” in combination with image clarity provides information about distance

## Question 14
**Pick the distance cue that matches the description below:**

Because a tree trunk is blocking your view of a building behind the tree trunk, you assume that the tree trunk is closer to you than the building.

- [ ] Accommodation
- [ ] Relative Size
- [ ] Motion Parallax
- [x] Occlusion
- [ ] Shape from Shading

## Question 15
**Pick the distance cue that matches the description below:**

There are two apples on the dining table. However, the image of one apple is larger on the retina than the other -- even though both apples are from the same apple orchard and therefore the same physical size. You assume that the apple with the larger retinal image is closer.

- [ ] Accommodation
- [x] Relative Size
- [ ] Occlusion
- [ ] Motion Parallax
- [ ] Shape from Shading
