# Third Quiz Answers

## Question 1
**TRUE or FALSE: An important aspect of visual perception involves evaluating the spatial patterns of light to identify boundaries. Such boundaries contribute to segregating the visual scene into objects that are distinct from each other and from the background.**

- [x] TRUE
- [ ] FALSE

- [ ] Fovea Centralis
- [ ] Convergence Angle
- [x] Receptive Field
- [ ] Scotoma

## Question 3
**Which of the following accurately describes the flow of information along a neuron?**

- [ ] Axon → Soma → Dendrites → Synapse
- [ ] Axon → Synapse → Soma → Dendrites
- [x] Dendrites → Soma → Axon → Synapse
- [ ] Synapse → Axon → Soma → Dendrites

## Question 4
**TRUE or FALSE: Visual information is first transduced (i.e. converted from a physical stimulus to an electrical response) in the retinal ganglion cells of the eye.**

- [ ] TRUE
- [x] FALSE

## Question 5
**Your friend is wearing a black shirt with white polka dots. What type of retinal ganglion cell would you expect to be activated by the white polka dots on a black background?**

- [x] “On” Center & “Off” Surround 
- [ ] “On” Left & “Off” Right
- [ ] “Off” Center & “On” Surround
- [ ] “Off” Left & “On” Right
- [ ] None of the above. 

## Question 6
**Retinal ganglion cell axons tend to maintain a “nearest-neighbor” relationship as they travel from the retina to the thalamus. What is this type of map that is maintained by the retinal ganglion cells called?**

- [ ] Somatotopic Map
- [ ] Visual Homunculus Map
- [ ] Audiotopic Map
- [x] Retinotopic Map
- [ ] Jeffress Map

## Question 7
**TRUE or FALSE: A given neuron in the visual cortex will respond the same way (i.e. fire action potentials at the same rate) to vertically and horizontally oriented visual stimuli.**

- [ ] TRUE
- [x] FALSE

## Question 8
**What is the most likely hypothesis of how a Kanizsa triangle is recognized as a triangle superimposed on the three black circles? (Choose the best answer.)**

- [ ] Visual cortical neurons respond selectively to triangles
- [ ] Some visual cortical neurons are specifically sensitive to illusory figures
- [x] Neighboring neurons with similar orientation sensitivity are partially activated, connecting the edges and contributing to a percept of a triangle
- [ ] None of the explanations above explains how the Kanizsa triangle illusion might happen

## Question 9
**Bart has had his foot amputated as a result of an accident. He now suffers from Phantom Limb Syndrome. According to the topographic map of the somatosensory cortex, what would most likely happen if his ankle were stroked with a brush?**

- [ ] Bart would feel a chilling sensation on his knee.
- [x] Bart would feel the stroking sensation on his ankle and also faintly in his amputated foot.
- [ ] Bart would feel the stroking sensation on his amputated foot only.
- [ ] None of the above.

## Question 10
**During the blind spot demonstration, when the mouse is in your blind spot, it will disappear; however, the bars of the cage appear uninterrupted. What is the explanation behind this phenomenon?**

- [x] Your brain is filling in the space to cover the gap, making inferences about the visual scene based on the area surrounding the blind spot.
- [ ] Mice are more salient (i.e. attention-grabbing) than cage bars.
- [ ] The bars are not in the blind spot.
- [ ] Your attention will only be on the mouse when you shift your attention, and since your brain cannot pay attention to two things at once, only the mouse disappears from your visual scene.

## Question 11
**TRUE or FALSE: We perceive all moving stimuli as moving regardless of how fast or slow they move.**

- [ ] TRUE
- [x] FALSE

## Question 12
**Which of the following have been discovered about the neurons in Area MT?**

- [ ] They are organized via a retinotopic map only.
- [ ] They are organized via a velocity map only.
- [x] They are organized in both a retinotopic and a velocity map.  
- [ ] None of the above statements have been discovered regarding neurons in Area MT.

## Question 13
**What is unique about smooth pursuit eye movements that differentiate them from saccades?**

- [ ] Smooth pursuit eye movements are the type of eye movements that we use for detecting 3D space.
- [x] Smooth pursuit eye movements can only occur if the eyes are following a particular stimulus’ movement.
- [ ] Smooth pursuit eye movements are rapid while saccades are slow.
- [ ] Smooth pursuit eye movements are only for careful, deliberate actions.

## Question 14
**What did the electrical stimulation experiment find about the nature of motion detection in area MT?**

- [ ] It is a winner take all process in which the velocity vector (speed and direction of motion) with the most “votes” is the one detected.
- [ ] It can be computed as the average of the velocity vectors (speed and direction of motion) present, resulting in the perception of a movement that is in between all the stimuli.
- [ ] It can be computed as a summation of the velocity vectors (speed and direction of motion).
- [x] All of the above explain motion detection in area MT.

## Question 15
**TRUE or FALSE: Synapses can be either excitatory or inhibitory.**

- [x] TRUE
- [ ] FALSE

## Question 16
**An experimenter wears prism goggles that shift the view slightly to the right. She then throws bean bags towards a target with one hand until she hits the target with relative consistency. She takes off the goggles and tries to throw one bean bag with her other hand. What would most likely happen?**

- [ ] She would throw the bean bag slightly to the right of the target.
- [ ] She would throw the bean bag slightly to the left of the target.
- [ ] She would throw the bean bag relatively to the center, towards the target.
- [x] The answer can’t be predicted from the information provided.

## Question 17
**The interaction of rhodopsin with photons leads to the cleavage of double bonds and ultimately a change in the electrical potential. Which of the following terms best describes the process by which photons lead to biological responses?**

- [ ] Transformation
- [ ] Refraction
- [ ] Conjugation
- [x] Transduction
- [ ] Action Potential

## Question 18

- [ ] It opens up the potassium channels.
- [ ] It closes the potassium channels.
- [ ] It opens the sodium channels. 
- [ ] It increases the membrane potential.
- [x] None of the above.
