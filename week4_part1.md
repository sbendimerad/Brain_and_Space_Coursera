# Quiz Answers

## Question 1
**Which of the following statements INCORRECTLY describes sound waves?**

- [ ] Sound waves can be described as having wavelength/frequency and amplitude.
- [ ] Sound waves consist of alternating regions of higher and lower pressure, due to variations in the density of air molecules, for example.
- [ ] In humans, sound waves are converted from pressure waves in air to pressure waves in fluid by the time they reach the cochlea in the inner ear.
- [x] Sound waves travel faster than light.

## Question 2
**Sound waves are transduced into electrical signals in the _____________.**

- [ ] Spectrum
- [ ] Pinna
- [x] Cochlea
- [ ] Ear Drum

## Question 3
**Which of the following anatomical features contribute(s) to transduction of auditory information in the cochlea of the inner ear?**

- [ ] Basilar membrane only
- [ ] Tympanic membrane only
- [ ] Tectorial membrane only
- [x] Interactions between the basilar membrane and the tectorial membrane

## Question 4
**Which of the following processes contribute(s) to sound localization in humans?**

- [ ] Interaural timing differences
- [ ] Interaural level differences
- [ ] Spectral cues
- [ ] Head movements
- [ ] Vision
- [x] All of the above.

## Question 5
**The center neuron acts as a “coincidence detector” meaning it responds most effectively when it receives input from the left and right neurons at about the same time. Which of the following accurately describe(s) the directional “preference” of the neuron (delay line) that is depicted below?**

- [ ] This neuron will respond more effectively to sound input that arrives to the left ear first.
- [x] This neuron will respond more effectively to sound input that arrives to the right ear first.
- [ ] This neuron will respond more effectively to sound input that coincidently arrives to both ears.
- [ ] This neuron will respond most effectively in the absence of sound input.
- [ ] Enough information is not provided to conclude the directional “preference” of this neuron.

## Question 6
**TRUE or FALSE: Interaural time differences and interaural level differences provide information adequate only for localizing sound in one dimension. This produces a “cone of confusion”.**

- [x] True
- [ ] False


## Question 8
**Frequency information about sound location is called a spectral cue. Which of the following statements regarding the contribution of spectral cues to sound localization is/are correct?**

- [ ] Spectral cues involve location-dependence in how the external ear filters the frequency content of sounds.
- [ ] Interaural time differences and interaural level differences are insufficient in localizing sound; spectral cues supplement these cues.
- [ ] Spectral cues allow us to localize sounds in any dimension: horizontal, vertical, front/back.
- [x] All of the above.

## Question 9
**Which of the following statements describe(s) how our ears are able to encode sound frequencies?**

- [ ] The basilar membrane has a resonance gradient along its length, meaning that different regions of the membrane oscillate better to different sound frequencies.
- [ ] Hair cells attached to the basilar membrane experience greater motion for some frequencies than for others, depending on their position with respect to the resonance gradient of the basilar membrane.
- [ ] Opening/closing of ion channels in hair cells are synchronized with the movement of the basilar membrane in a process known as phaselocking.
- [x] All of the above describe how our ears encode sound frequencies.

## Question 10
**How must the brain interpret spectral cues to overcome the fact that it only has access to signals produced after a sound has been filtered by the external ear?**

- [ ] A. It compares the currently perceived sound with memories of previous similar sounds.
- [ ] B. It compares what is felt in the pinna and what is heard.
- [ ] C. It compares the currently perceived sound across the two ears, which provides a way of assessing what the likely “raw” (unfiltered) frequency content of the sound might be.
- [x] Both A & C
- [ ] Both A & B

## Question 11
**Vision can “capture” the perceived location of sounds even when they are not actually coming from that given location. This phenomenon is also known as:**

- [ ] Occlusion
- [x] Ventriloquism
- [ ] Spectral Cues
- [ ] McGurk Effect

## Question 12
**What does the phenomenon mentioned in question 11 show about the relationship between audition and vision?**

- [ ] They are used simultaneously to calibrate localization for each other.
- [x] Vision can be used to calibrate sound localization.
- [ ] They are not related in any way.
- [ ] Audition can be used to calibrate vision.

## Question 13
**What best describes the only way to tell how far away a sound is without relying on prior knowledge about the sound’s loudness?**

- [ ] Duration of the tone to compute the time it traveled.
- [x] The relative delay of echoes that are associated with the sound; closer sounds will precede their echoes by a greater amount than more distant sounds will.
- [ ] The relative delay of echoes that are associated with the sound; more distant sounds will precede their echoes by a greater amount than closer sounds will.
- [ ] The absence of echoes to pinpoint a particular pitch.
