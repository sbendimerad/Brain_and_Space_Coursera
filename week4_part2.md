# Quiz Answers

## Question 1
**What constitutes a map of neural activity patterns?**

- [ ] Individual neurons must be tuned to a specific stimulus location.
- [ ] A population of neurons must contain individual neurons that are tuned differently.
- [ ] A population of neurons must represent each possible point in space.
- [x] All of the above.

## Question 2
**Which accurately depicts the relationship between neural activity patterns, desired movements and sensory stimuli?**

- [x] Sensory stimuli, desired movements, and neural activity can all be both representation and information being represented, depending on the context.
- [ ] Neural activity forms the representation, and sensory stimuli or desired movements are the information being represented.
- [ ] Sensory stimuli and neural activity patterns form the representations, and desired movement is the information being represented.
- [ ] Sensory stimuli and desired movement form the representations, and neural activity patterns constitute the information being represented.

## Question 3
**Which of the following statement(s), if any, are correct?**

- [ ] A. The brain has direct “knowledge” of the sensory stimulus, independent of sensory receptors, which it uses to create its neural activity patterns.
- [x] B. Everything the brain “knows” about the world comes from measurements taken by sensory receptors. The brain must infer what stimuli are likely to have caused the resulting neural activity patterns.
- [ ] Both A and B.
- [ ] Neither A nor B.

## Question 4
**Which of the following is false regarding the information necessary to indicate the stimulus location using a meter?**

- [ ] Neurons exhibit tuned responses with a peak for a particular stimulus location.
- [ ] The activity level (spiking of neurons) varies proportionately with a stimulus parameter such as location.
- [ ] The activity level (spiking of neurons) to a given stimulus can be used to deduce its location.
- [x] A combination of neurons can be used to indicate the actual value of the stimulus.


## Question 6
**In the Superior Colliculus motor map, stimulation of which of the following quadrants will cause small, upward eye movement?**

- [ ] C. Caudal-lateral
- [ ] A. Rostro-lateral
- [x] B. Rostro-medial
- [ ] D. Caudal-medial

## Question 7
**Select all statements that are true about saccades.**

- [x] Saccades are used to aid visual acuity.
- [ ] Saccades are only made for visual stimuli and not for auditory stimuli.
- [x] Saccades allow us to aim our fovea at one particular thing to direct our attention.
- [ ] Visual signals must be transformed from their original maps into meters to generate a motor command.

## Question 8
**TRUE or FALSE: A monkey named George makes an eye movement to look at another monkey, named Martha, as she grunts. Inside George’s superior colliculus, neurons respond the same way to the visual stimulus (Martha’s mouth movement) and the auditory stimulus (Martha’s vocalization).**

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Question 9
**Which of the following is NOT a requirement for meters?**

- [ ] Meters need a sensible axis for organizing the information encoded by meters.
- [ ] Individual neurons should have predominantly monotonic response patterns, meaning that their activity changes in the neurons should be roughly proportional to a stimulus parameter.
- [ ] The brain might use a population of neurons that show increasing and decreasing functions as a comparison to indicate the actual value of the stimulus.
- [x] Individual neurons should exhibit tuning and respond better to particular ranges in stimulus parameters.

## Question 10
**TRUE or FALSE: Whereas individual neurons in a meter representation are tuned to a stimulus parameter, meaning that these neurons respond better to selective ranges in stimuli, individual neurons in a map representation have predominantly monotonic response patterns, meaning that neuronal response is roughly proportional to a particular stimulus parameter.**

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Question 11
**While out for a walk, a butterfly floats past your face. The butterfly is exquisite, so you make smooth pursuit eye movements to follow the butterfly’s trajectory. Which of the following describes why a map needs to be converted to a meter so that you can continue to stare at the butterfly?**

- [ ] Maps must be converted into meters because of limitations in human memory.
- [ ] The elaborate nature of the stimulus (butterfly) requires a conversion of maps to meters for proper interpretation of interaural level differences.
- [x] The (activity of neurons in your) brain forms a representation of the butterfly’s location in space using a map, but moving the eyes at a certain speed requires a certain amount of force. Because force scales proportionately with neural activity, the brain map needs to be converted to a meter.
- [ ] The brain only understands meters, so the maps formed by your eyes must first be converted to meters.
