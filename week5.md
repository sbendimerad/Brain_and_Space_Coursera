## Question 1
**Which statement(s) is/are true regarding the reference frame? Choose all possible choices.**

- [x] There are many different potential reference frames for a given location of an object, and they can all accurately describe the location of an object.

- [x] False

## Question 8
**Ebrahim is watching Jeff Dunham perform a skit. After Jeff and his puppet friend leave the stage, a recording of Jeff’s “puppet voice” is played through the same sound system. Ebrahim perceives this sound as coming from where the puppet was sitting during the majority of the act. What does this instance tell him about vision and sound localization?**

- [ ] Sound can only be localized based on head and body movements.
- [x] Vision exerts a lasting effect on sound localization.
- [ ] The visual stimulus affects the perception of sound location only while the visual stimulus is present.
- [ ] The visual scene is perceived as stable despite movements of the eyes.

## Question 9
**Which of the following statements concerning the reference frame of auditory cues to location is/are correct?**

- [ ] Interaural time differences depend on the location of the sound with respect to the eyes.
- [x] Interaural level differences depend on the location of the sound with respect to the ears and head.
- [ ] Spectral cues depend on the location of the sound with respect to the eyes.
- [ ] All of the above.

## Question 10
**Which of the following are involved in knowing where you are and getting from one place to another?**

- [ ] A. Visual Commands
- [ ] B. Motor Commands
- [ ] C. Vestibular Commands
- [ ] D. Both A and C
- [x] E. A, B, and C.

## Question 11
**Which of the following structures is NOT associated with the vestibular system?**

- [x] Ear drum
- [ ] Utricle
- [ ] Saccule
- [ ] Cupula
- [ ] Otoconia

## Question 12
**Which of the following vestibular structures detects head rotation?**

- [ ] Saccule
- [ ] Utricle
- [ ] Oval Window
- [ ] Tympanic Membrane
- [x] Semicircular Canals

## Question 13
**Which of the following serves as evidence that the auditory system might have evolved from the vestibular system?**

- [x] Both the auditory system and vestibular system produce electrical impulses via the opening and closing of ion channels in hair cells.
- [ ] Both the auditory and vestibular systems are involved in sound transduction.
- [ ] Both the auditory and vestibular systems are involved in maintaining balance and coordination.
- [ ] All of the above.

## Question 14
**Which of the following processes is most similar to how the semicircular canals detect information about head rotation via hair cells in the cupula?**

- [ ] Visual Transduction In The Thalamus - Neurons transmit electrical impulses in a retinotopic map to the visual cortex.
- [ ] Visual Transduction In The Retina - Neurons hyperpolarize due to the changing configuration of rhodopsin to opsin upon photon exposure.
- [x] Sound Transduction In The Cochlea - Hair cells open and close due to a resonating basilar membrane, leading to the opening and closing of ion channels.
- [ ] Sound Transduction In The Middle Ear - Sound vibrations are passed from the eardrum to the three middle ear bones.

## Question 15
**(True/False) According to the buoyancy hypothesis, alcohol diffuses into the cupula at a faster rate than the region surrounding the cupula, leading to a density gradient within the semicircular canals of the vestibular system that disrupts neural signals involved in maintaining balance.**

- [x] True
- [ ] False

## Question 16
**According to Wittinger, an ant that is captured at the food source and whose legs are subsequently lengthened via stilts is most likely to __________.**

- [x] overshoot the location of the ant nest
- [ ] undershoot the location of the ant nest
- [ ] accurately pinpoint the location of the ant nest
- [ ] None of the above are correct.

## Question 17
**Which of the following statements regarding vision and navigation are correct? Choose all that apply**

- [x] Visual motion information works in concert with vestibular signals to contribute to your sense of movement through space.
- [x] The pattern of visual motion on the retina as we move is known as optic flow.
- [ ] Visual motion contributes to navigation in desert ants but not in humans.
- [x] The pattern of visual motion on the retina can induce a sense of self-movement.

## Question 18
**Eye movements have been discussed in numerous contexts. Which of the following statements about eye movements are correct? Choose all that apply.**

- [x] Saccades are eye movements that aim the fovea at either visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli.
- [x] Saccades aid visual acuity.
- [ ] Saccades are usually straight.
- [x] Smooth pursuit eye movements are eye movements to track a moving stimulus.
- [x] Smooth pursuit eye movements generally only occur when there is a real moving visual stimulus and can’t be made without such a stimulus.

## Question 19
**Identifying sounds based on spectral cues is dependent on an individual’s ability to associate spectral cues with learned sounds in order to compare something measurable (the frequency content in the ear canal) with something not directly known (the frequency content at the source). Which of the following is MOST similar to spectral cues in that it relies on learned associations?**

- [x] Relative Size - The retinal image size must be compared with prior knowledge about the physical size of the corresponding object.
- [ ] Occlusion - The retinal image is occluded during blinking, a learned behavior.
- [ ] Motion Parallax - Parallel lines in the retinal image must be compared to learned knowledge of parallel lines.
- [ ] Stereovision - The retinal image location must be compared with prior knowledge about the location in the other eye.
