# Seventh Quiz Answers

## Question 1
**Which of the following statements concerning memory are correct? Choose all that apply.**

- [x] Neural mechanisms related to memory have been observed in areas of the brain that also appear to play a role in sensory and motor processing.
- [x] Memory-related signals/processes have been observed in parietal cortex.
- [x] The strength of synapses can change, and this is thought to be one of the ways that the brain stores information.
- [x] The “memory” for a stimulus can be reflected in neural activity that persists even after the stimulus is gone.

## Question 2
**The method of loci:**

- [x] All of the above.

## Question 3
**If Svetlana knows how to play the balalaika, would she immediately be able to play the banjo if Dr. Groh handed her one? Choose the BEST answer.**

- [x] She may be able to get the basics since she has prior knowledge of finger techniques on a stringed instrument, but differences in the location and tuning of the strings on the banjo would make it challenging for her to play.

## Question 4
**TRUE or FALSE: Brain areas that exhibit neural activity in memory-related tasks overlap with those that exhibit activity in sensory/motor tasks.**

- [x] True

## Question 5
**Which pattern best reflects the neural basis of memory that occurs during a delayed response task?**

- [x] Neural activity is triggered by the sensory stimulus, persists at a diminished level after the stimulus is turned off, and lasts until the response occurs.

## Question 6
**TRUE or FALSE: Memory is stored in both neural activity and in the strength of synaptic connections.**

- [x] True

## Question 7
**Which of the following statements concerning the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is/are correct?**

- [x] All of the above.

## Question 8
**How is the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) calibrated?**

- [x] It is calibrated through the changes in synaptic strength involving a pathway separate from the pathway that implements the VOR.

## Question 9
**Which of the following statements correctly describe(s) a characteristic of the parietal cortex in relation to space and memory?**

- [x] All of the above are correct.

## Question 11
**Which of the following statements correctly describe characteristics of the hippocampus? Choose all that apply.**

- [x] The hippocampus is involved in the formation of episodic and declarative memories.
- [x] Lesions in the hippocampus can lead to anterograde amnesia.
- [x] Specific neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are involved in encoding location, head direction, and distance and are crucial in our ability to navigate.
- [x] Rats with lesions in the hippocampus are impaired at localizing a platform hidden underwater when participating in the Morris Water Maze task.

## Question 12
**Stella is stargazing and walks into an open field. Which of the following structures probably allowed Stella to navigate herself so accurately from Point B to Point A?**

- [x] All of the above allowed Stella to navigate to Point A.

## Question 13
**TRUE or FALSE: Neurons can only do one thing at a time. For example, a single neuron located in the hippocampus can only be involved in sensing movements and nothing else.**

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Question 14
**TRUE or FALSE: Neuroscientists theorize that cognitive processes in the brain such as attention, memory, and planning overlap with sensory/motor processing regions in the brain. This is also known as the Theory of Embodied/Grounded Cognition.**

- [x] True

## Question 15
**In the Shepard & Metzler experiment, the subjects were asked to determine whether object A is the same as object B but with a different orientation. The subjects reacted faster if the angle of rotation was smaller, and this may be because:**

- [x] The subjects mentally simulated rotating the object, so the mental simulation took longer to process if the object had to be rotated for a larger angle.

## Question 16
**In the figure from the Hauk, Johnsrude and Pulvermuller study, which of the following might also produce activation within the region labeled A? Select all that apply.**

- [x] Reading the word “punch”
- [ ] Smelling freshly cut grass on a spring afternoon
- [ ] Looking at a picture of a pianist playing piano
- [x] Hitting a ball with a bat
- [ ] Reading the word “approbation”

## Question 17
**TRUE or FALSE: Abstract concepts can be "perceived" in only one way, because there is only one way they can be tied to something concrete (such as connecting emotions to temperature).**

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Question 18
**In English, the standard order of events goes from left to right. However, in Hebrew, the standard order of events goes from right to left. What is Nava's most likely response to Andrew's layout of number cards?**

- [ ] The set of cards is in the correct order
- [x] The set of cards is out of order
- [ ] The order of the set of cards is reversed

## Question 19
**Which of the following statements concerning the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is/are correct? Choose all that apply.**

- [x] The gain of the VOR changes when you put on a pair of eyeglasses.
- [x] The gain of the VOR must be properly calibrated to keep compensatory eye movements matched to head movements.
- [x] The VOR is a mechanism for holding the eyes as stable as possible as you move.
